        <p>Welcome to the CCIS 2022!</p> <br>
        <p>Man-made climate change continues to be one of the biggest threats to Planet Earth. As the climate continues to change, millions of poor people face greater challenges in terms of extreme events, health effects, food security, livelihood security, migration, water security, cultural identity, and other related risks. Feeding the increasing global population requires intensive agriculture using innovative technologies. As agriculture is among the major contributors to global warming, emitting more greenhouse gases than all others – largely methane released by livestock and rice farms, nitrous oxide from fertilized fields and carbon dioxide from the cutting of rain forests to grow crops or raise livestock. Therefore, agricultural practices without compromising the environment, soil and water on Earth planet need to adopt sustainable ways. </p><br>
        <p>Moreover, climate has a direct and obvious effect on agricultural production. Situation is worsening in Pakistan which is among the countries most likely to be affected by climate change. Present conference is aimed to highlight “Climate change: Impacts & Solutions”.</p><br>
        <p><b>University of Agriculture Faisalabad (UAF)</b>, founded in 1906 as college, the mother institution of most of the agrarians in Pakistan, is aware of the scenarios under changing climate and striving for food security. Several projects have been worked out at campus to combat the challenges of climate change and a comprehensive research degree in Climate Change [M.Sc. (Hons) Climate Change] is being offered to identify the innovative solutions for food security in changing climate.</p><br/>
        <p><b>Institute of Soil & Environmental Sciences</b> has transformed itself to face the challenges of the new era. Keeping in view the requirements of new era, this Institute has widened its scope and has witnessed paradigm shift in its academic and research activities from traditional domain of Soil Science to Environmental Sciences and Climate Change. Currently, Institute is endeavoring to excel in academics and research in the fields of Soil, Environment and Climate Change. To meet the academic and research requirement of the modern era, Institute is providing education and conducting research in the fields of soil and environmental sciences and climate change. Institute of Soil and Environmental Sciences, UAF is organizing a conference at the University of Agriculture Faisalabad during November 07-09, 2022.</p><br/>
